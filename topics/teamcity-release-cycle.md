Generally, TeamCity release stages are:
* __Available under EAP (Early Access Program)__: usually available only for major releases, starts several months after the previous major release and several months before the next major release. Typically, new EAP releases are [published](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/nextversion/) on monthly or bimonthly basis.
* __General Availability__: as a rule, there is a major release each 8 months. There are multiple bugfix releases following the major release. Bugfix releases and support patches for critical issues (if applicable) are provided until "End of Sale" of the release.
* __End of Sale__ â€“ occurs with the release of a new major version. After this time no bugfix updates or patches are usually provided (Exceptions are critical issues without a workaround which at the same time allow for relatively simple fix and inability for the customer to upgrade for an important reason). Only limited support is provided for these versions.
* __End of Support__ - occurs with the release of two newer major versions. At this point, we stop providing regular technical support for the release.

The dates of previous releases and the sequence of TeamCity versions are listed [here](previous-releases-downloads.md).
